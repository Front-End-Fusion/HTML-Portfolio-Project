      Hello! My name is Shane Leonard and Im a full-stack software engineer. Im
      passionate about building custom gaming PCs and creating software
      development projects such as web apps, beautiful websites, social media
      platforms, and much more. When Im not coding, you can find me taking walks
      in nature or enjoying a cup of coffee. I classify myself as a coffee
      fanatic and love trying new blends from around the world.
